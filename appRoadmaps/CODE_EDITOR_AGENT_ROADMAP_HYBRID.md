# Code Editor Hybrid Framework Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the development of a hybrid code editor framework that combines direct API operations with agent-assisted intelligence.

## Implementation Strategy

### Architecture Overview

The hybrid code editor framework will consist of three main layers:

1. **Direct Operations Layer**
   - Handles basic file and editor operations
   - Implemented as efficient API endpoints
   - Provides fast, reliable core functionality

2. **Agent Intelligence Layer**
   - Provides code generation and analysis
   - Offers suggestions and explanations
   - Handles complex language understanding

3. **UI Integration Layer**
   - Combines direct operations and agent intelligence
   - Provides seamless user experience
   - Handles transitions between modes

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**
  - FastAPI or Express for API endpoints
  - WebSockets for real-time communication
  - File system operations for direct file handling
  - Agent integration for intelligence features

- **Frontend**
  - React for UI components
  - Monaco Editor or CodeMirror for text editing
  - Server-sent events or WebSockets for real-time updates
  - State management with React Context or Redux

### Development Approach

For each phase, we'll follow this approach:

1. **Start from scratch** rather than overhauling the existing implementation
   - This allows for a clean architecture designed specifically for the hybrid approach
   - Enables better separation of concerns between direct operations and agent intelligence
   - Provides a more maintainable and extensible codebase

2. **Implement core functionality first**
   - Focus on the direct operations layer initially
   - Ensure basic file operations work efficiently
   - Create a solid foundation for more advanced features

3. **Add agent intelligence incrementally**
   - Start with basic code generation
   - Add more advanced features in later phases
   - Ensure seamless integration with direct operations

4. **Test thoroughly at each stage**
   - Verify both direct operations and agent features
   - Test transitions between modes
   - Ensure performance meets expectations
