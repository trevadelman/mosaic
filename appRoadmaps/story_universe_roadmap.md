# Story Universe Explorer Agent Implementation Roadmap

## Overview
The Story Universe Explorer is an agent that combines creative writing with interactive visualization. It allows users to generate and explore interconnected story elements (characters, places, events) through an interactive graph visualization.

## Phase 1: Minimal Viable Agent Implementation
- [x] Create roadmap document
- [x] Create basic agent structure
  - [x] Implement `story_universe_agent.py` with essential tools
  - [x] Define the agent class with custom view properties
  - [x] Register the agent with the system
- [x] Implement core story generation tools
  - [x] Create a basic story element generation tool
  - [x] Implement a simple relationship creation tool
  - [x] Add a universe state management tool
- [x] Test the basic agent in chat mode
  - [x] Verify the agent can generate story elements
  - [x] Test the agent's ability to maintain state
  - [x] Ensure proper registration and discovery

## Phase 2: Minimal Viable UI Implementation
- [x] Create the basic UI structure
  - [x] Set up the view directory structure
  - [x] Implement a simple `index.tsx` with layout definition
  - [x] Create placeholder components for the main visualization and sidebar
- [x] Implement a basic visualization component
  - [x] Create a simple HTML/CSS representation of the graph
  - [x] Implement basic element and relationship rendering
  - [x] Add minimal interaction capabilities
- [x] Create a basic sidebar component
  - [x] Implement element details display
  - [x] Add simple controls for generating new elements
  - [x] Create a basic filter system
- [x] Test the minimal UI
  - [x] Verify the UI appears in the agent selector
  - [x] Test basic visualization rendering
  - [x] Ensure communication between UI and agent tools

## Phase 3: Iterative Enhancement - Core Functionality
- [x] Enhance story generation capabilities
  - [x] Improve element generation with more detailed prompts
  - [x] Add specific character, location, and event generation
  - [x] Implement relationship analysis
  - [x] Add "universe generator" tool to create complete story universes with multiple elements and relationships
- [ ] Improve visualization interactivity
  - [ ] Add node dragging and positioning
  - [ ] Implement double-click to expand functionality
  - [ ] Create hover information display
- [ ] Enhance sidebar functionality
  - [ ] Add element editing capabilities
  - [ ] Implement relationship management
  - [ ] Create controls for visualization settings
- [ ] Test enhanced functionality
  - [ ] Verify all interactions work as expected
  - [ ] Test the agent's ability to maintain complex state
  - [ ] Ensure visualization correctly represents the story universe

## Phase 4: Iterative Enhancement - Advanced Features
- [ ] Add context menu and advanced interactions
  - [ ] Implement right-click context menu
  - [ ] Add node expansion options
  - [ ] Create relationship manipulation controls
- [ ] Enhance visualization aesthetics
  - [ ] Implement dynamic node sizing based on importance
  - [ ] Add color schemes for different element types
  - [ ] Improve edge styling for relationship types
- [ ] Add state persistence
  - [ ] Implement saving/loading of story universes
  - [ ] Add export functionality
  - [ ] Create snapshot system for version control
- [ ] Test advanced features
  - [ ] Verify context menu and advanced interactions
  - [ ] Test visualization aesthetics
  - [ ] Ensure state persistence works correctly

## Phase 5: Refinement and Polish
- [ ] Optimize performance
  - [ ] Improve graph rendering efficiency
  - [ ] Enhance state management
  - [ ] Optimize tool invocation
- [ ] Improve user experience
  - [ ] Add helpful tooltips and guidance
  - [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts
  - [ ] Create a more intuitive interface
- [ ] Add final features
  - [ ] Implement theme analysis if time permits
  - [ ] Add timeline visualization if feasible
  - [ ] Create story consistency checking tools
- [ ] Final testing and refinement
  - [ ] Conduct comprehensive testing
  - [ ] Address any remaining issues
  - [ ] Polish the user interface

## Implementation Strategy
For each phase:
1. Implement backend first: Create the agent and tools, then test via chat interface
2. Implement frontend: Create the UI components that utilize the agent's tools
3. Test integration: Verify the UI correctly interacts with the agent
4. Gather feedback: Test the implementation and gather feedback
5. Refine: Make improvements based on testing and feedback
