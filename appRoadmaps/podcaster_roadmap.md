# Universal Podcaster Agent Implementation Roadmap

## Overview
The Universal Podcaster is an agent that leverages OpenAI's text-to-speech and speech-to-text capabilities to create podcast-style audio content. It features high-quality voice synthesis using Shimmer (female) and Echo (male) voices, with a focus on natural-sounding speech and easy content generation.

## Phase 1: Minimal Viable Agent Implementation
- [x] Create roadmap document
- [x] Create basic agent structure
  - [x] Implement `podcaster_agent.py` with essential tools
  - [x] Define the agent class with custom view properties
  - [x] Register the agent with the system
- [x] Implement core audio tools
  - [x] Create text-to-speech generation tool using OpenAI TTS API
  - [x] Implement voice selection (Shimmer/Echo)
  - [x] Add basic audio state management
- [x] Test the basic agent in chat mode
  - [x] Verify text-to-speech generation (requires UI)
  - [x] Test voice switching capabilities (requires UI)
  - [x] Ensure proper registration and discovery

## Phase 2: Minimal Viable UI Implementation
- [x] Create the basic UI structure
  - [x] Set up the view directory structure
  - [x] Implement a simple `index.tsx` with layout definition
  - [x] Create placeholder components for input and audio player
- [x] Implement audio player component
  - [x] Create basic audio playback controls
  - [x] Implement simple waveform visualization
  - [x] Add voice selection interface
- [x] Create input control panel
  - [x] Implement text input area
  - [x] Add voice configuration options
  - [x] Create basic export controls
- [x] Test the minimal UI
  - [x] Verify the UI appears in the agent selector
  - [x] Test audio playback functionality
  - [x] Ensure communication between UI and agent tools

## Phase 3: Iterative Enhancement - Core Functionality âœ“
- [x] Enhance audio generation capabilities
  - [x] Implement audio quality settings (tts-1 vs tts-1-hd)
  - [x] Add format selection (mp3, opus, aac, etc.)
- [x] Improve audio player functionality
  - [x] Add download button
  - [x] Add error retry mechanism
- [x] Enhance control panel features
  - [x] Implement speed controls
  - [x] Add character count/limit display
  - [x] Add clear button for text input
- [x] Test enhanced functionality
  - [x] Test different audio formats
  - [x] Ensure voice customization is effective

## Phase 4: Iterative Enhancement - Advanced Features
- [x] Add LLM-powered content generation
  - [x] Add prompt input for LLM text generation
  - [x] Implement LLM text generation tool
  - [x] Create preview/edit interface for generated text
- [x] Prepare UI for interactive features
  - [x] Add tab system for different modes
  - [x] Create "Create a Podcast" tab
  - [x] Create "Talk to a Podcaster" tab placeholder
- [ ] Implement conversational pipeline
  - [ ] Add audio recording functionality
  - [ ] Implement Whisper transcription
  - [ ] Add conversational LLM processing
  - [ ] Generate AI responses with TTS
- [ ] Enhance audio processing
  - [ ] Add background noise handling
  - [ ] Implement audio normalization
  - [ ] Create multi-segment management
- [ ] Add content management
  - [ ] Implement project saving/loading
  - [ ] Add export functionality
  - [ ] Create audio library system
- [ ] Test advanced features
  - [ ] Verify transcription accuracy
  - [ ] Test audio processing quality
  - [ ] Ensure state persistence works correctly

## Phase 5: Refinement and Polish
- [ ] Optimize performance
  - [ ] Improve audio processing efficiency
  - [ ] Enhance streaming reliability
  - [ ] Optimize state management
- [ ] Improve user experience
  - [ ] Add helpful tooltips and guidance
  - [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts
  - [ ] Create a more intuitive interface
- [ ] Add final features
  - [ ] Implement batch processing
  - [ ] Add voice preset system
  - [ ] Create advanced export options
- [ ] Final testing and refinement
  - [ ] Conduct comprehensive testing
  - [ ] Address any remaining issues
  - [ ] Polish the user interface

## Implementation Strategy
For each phase:
1. Implement backend first: Create the agent and tools, then test via chat interface
2. Implement frontend: Create the UI components that utilize the agent's tools
3. Test integration: Verify the UI correctly interacts with the agent
4. Gather feedback: Test the implementation and gather feedback
5. Refine: Make improvements based on testing and feedback

## Testing Approach
- Test each feature through the actual application
- Verify audio quality and voice characteristics
- Ensure proper error handling and user feedback
- Test performance with various content lengths
- Validate all supported audio formats
